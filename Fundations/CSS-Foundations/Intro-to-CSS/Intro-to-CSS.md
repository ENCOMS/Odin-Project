## Add styles to HTML with CSS.

### Basic syntax

CSS is made of up of various rules:
- Selector
- Semicolon-separated list of declarations
- Each declaration being made up of property-value pair


Selector
    |
div.bold-text {
    font-weigth: 700
        |         |   
    property    value
}

note: 
A <div> is one of the basic HTML elements. It is an empty container. In general, it is best to use other tags such as <h1> or <p> for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS youâ€™ll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements.

### Selectors
### Universal selector
### Type selectors
### Class selectors
### Id selectors
### the grouping selectors
### Chaining selectors
